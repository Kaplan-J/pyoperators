The current version of the pyoperators package is 0.1, and it is still beta.
The project is hosted at "github":https://github.com/pchanial/pyoperators/ and there are two ways to obtain it.
  
* Either by retrieving an archive
    - as a "tar file":https://github.com/pchanial/pyoperators/tarball/v0.1/
    - or a "zip file":https://github.com/pchanial/pyoperators/zipball/v0.1/.
<br/>
* Alternatively, by cloning the project, using the version control system "Git":http://git-scm.com/:

bc. $ git clone git://github.com/pchanial/pyoperators.git

The second method is more convenient to make updates (if you've just cloned the repository, you will obviously not get anything new)

bc. $ cd pyoperators.git
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.

This method is also required if you are to test pyoperators' development branch.


Once the package has been retrieved, you may proceed to the "installation":{{site.baseurl}}/installation.
