excerpt: Install pyoperators package
---

<br>
The PyOperators package is under the "CECILL-B":http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.html license, a BSD-like free software license, with a citation requirement. The source code and development is hosted at "github":https://github.com/pchanial/pyoperators. The current version of the pyoperators package is {{ site.version_stable }}.

h1. Preparation

h2. The pip utility

The "pip":http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html program allows the installation of Python packages from the internet. It is recommended to use it instead of easy_install, which cannot uninstall packages. If @pip@ is not installed, but @easy_install@ is (or @easy_install-2.7@),  the latter can be used to install the former. First, check that @easy_install@ actually runs the Python interpreter you're using, by inspecting its first first line of code. Then, type

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo easy_install pip
{% endhighlight %}

h2. The pyFFTW module

The FFTW package and its Python wrapper need to be installed first.


* on Linux/Ubuntu with root permissions, this will simply be:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
$ sudo pip install pyFFTW
{% endhighlight %}

* on Linux, without root permissions, one should make sure that the following libraries are available: @libfftw3.so@, @libfftw3f.so@, @libfftw3l.so@, @libfftw3_threads.so@, @libfftw3f_threads.so@, @libfftw3l_threads.so@ in a directory @${FFTWPATH}/lib@ and that the file @fftw3.h@ is in @${FFTWPATH}/include@. This "bash script":install-fftw.sh can help for this purpose. Then the wrapper can be installed locally:

{% highlight bash %}
$ MYSOFTDIR=~/software/lib/python2.7/site-packages
$ CPATH=${FFTWPATH}/include LIBRARY_PATH=${FFTWPATH}/lib pip install pyFFTW --install-option="--install-lib=${MYSOFTDIR}"

$ export PYTHONPATH=${MYSOFTDIR}:${PYTHONPATH}
$ python -c "import pyfftw; print('Successful installation!')"
{% endhighlight %}


* on MacOS X, using the MacPorts Python interpreter:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo port install py-pyfftw
{% endhighlight %}

* on MacOS X, using the default Python interpreter or that from a distribution such as Anaconda or Enthought. Note that depending on your installation, a @sudo@ might be required.

With MacPort:
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo port install fftw-3 fftw-3-long fftw-3-single
$ CPATH=/opt/local/include LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib pip install pyFFTW
{% endhighlight %}

With HomeBrew:
{% highlight bash %}
$ brew install fftw
$ CPATH=/usr/local/include LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib pip install pyFFTW
{% endhighlight %}

h1. Installation

h2. The easy way

The easiest way to download and install the PyOperators package is by using pip. It will fetch the package and its dependencies from the "Python Package Index":http://pypi.python.org/pypi and install them.

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo pip install pyoperators
{% endhighlight %}

To upgrade an already installed PyOperators package:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pyoperators 
{% endhighlight %}

h2. The Git way

You can also clone the Github repository, using the version control system "Git":http://git-scm.com/:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/pchanial/pyoperators
$ sudo pip install ./pyoperators
{% endhighlight %}

This method is convenient to test PyOperators' development branch but package dependencies must be installed beforehand (see the "setup.py":https://github.com/pchanial/pyoperators/blob/v{{site.version_stable}}/setup.py file for the list of requirements). The package can be updated by typing (if you've just cloned the repository, you will obviously not get anything new):

{% highlight bash %}
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
{% endhighlight %}
