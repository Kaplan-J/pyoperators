What's new ?
* DistributionGlobalOperator: operator for distributing global inputs via MPI
* DistributionIdentityOperator: operator for MPI reductions
* DenseOperator: an operator for dense operations
* allocation messages are now switched off. To print them back: @pyoperators.memory.verbose=True@
* Implement "binary":{{ site.baseurl }}/2000/doc-operators/#binary_rules rule priorities
* Make the result of a binary rule compatible with the in/out attributes of the pair of operators
* implement "unary":{{ site.baseurl }}/2000/doc-operators/#unary_rules rules instead of the less flexible 'associated_operators' mechanism
* add shape_input, shape_output, inplace and inplace_reductions to operator's "flags":{{ site.baseurl }}/2000/doc-operators/#operator_flags
* DirectOperatorFactory and ReverseOperatorFactory
* ZeroOperator to handle inplace reductions
* API changes: block operators must be instanciated with a @axisin@(@out@) or @new_axisin@(@out@) keyword, the default call without any keyword is reserved for future free partitioning
